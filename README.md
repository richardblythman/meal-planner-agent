## 🤖 About the Meal Planning Agent

The Meal Planning Agent is your personal nutrition assistant that helps you plan balanced meals, track nutritional intake, manage shopping lists, and investigate potential food-related digestive issues.

### Core Workflows

1. **Meal Planning & Optimization** – Select meals for the week, and the agent analyzes nutritional completeness, suggests improvements, and identifies gaps
2. **Shopping List Generation** – Consolidates ingredients from your selected meals into organized shopping lists
3. **Digestive Health Analysis** – Correlates Bristol scale symptom logs with meals consumed to help identify potential food triggers
