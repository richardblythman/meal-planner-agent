# Almond-Quinoa and Salmon Bowls (1.5x - Dinner-to-Lunch Prep)

Sometimes there is a single ingredient that takes all the credit for bringing a Buddha bowl to life. In this case, it's the Roasted Red Pepper Sauce. Inspired by romesco, a smoky red pepper and almond sauce that hails from Spain, this version is a true gem. It's creamy and rich, almost decadent, yet totally healthy and surprisingly easy to pull together in just minutes. Here, it accents the fatty salmon, tempers the bitter bite of broccolini and arugula, and makes a nice partner to the almond-studded quinoa, to really tie the whole bowl together.

**This version is scaled 1.5x for making dinner with lunch leftovers in mind.**

## Ingredients

- 262.5g quinoa, rinsed
- 3 cups (705 ml) water
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 55.5ml avocado or extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 54g chopped toasted almonds, plus more for topping
- 660g salmon fillets (6 fillets)
- 450g tender stem broccoli
- 420g beets, peeled and thinly sliced
- 60g arugula

## Instructions

1. Combine the quinoa, water, and a generous pinch of salt in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover with a lid, and steam for about 5 minutes. Fluff the quinoa with a fork, and then stir in half of the oil and the almonds.

2. Arrange an oven rack about 6 inches below the broiler, and set the oven to broil.

3. Arrange the salmon on one side of a large rimmed baking sheet, skin-side down. Lightly brush with half of the remaining oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss the broccolini with the remaining oil, salt, and pepper. Spread the broccolini in a single layer on the other side of the baking sheet. Broil until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily, 7 to 9 minutes, depending on thickness (slightly longer than the base recipe due to increased quantity).

4. To serve, divide the quinoa among bowls. Top with salmon, broccolini, beets, and arugula. Drizzle with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce (if desired) and sprinkle with almonds.
