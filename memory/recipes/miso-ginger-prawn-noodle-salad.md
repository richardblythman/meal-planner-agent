## Ingredients

### For the Salad

- 100g frozen edamame *(no component - Asian supermarket)*
- 1 tsp sesame oil *(no component - pantry staple)*

- 1 spring onion, sliced *(no component - pantry staple)*
- 100g [sugar snap peas](../components/vegetables/sugar-snap-peas.md), halved if you like
- 1 red chilli, sliced (deseeded if you prefer less heat) *(no component - pantry staple)*
- 400g [king prawns](../components/proteins/king-prawns.md), peeled and cooked (100g per serving)
- 1 tsp sesame seeds *(no component - pantry staple)*

### For the Dressing
- 1 tbsp freshly grated ginger *(no component - pantry staple)*
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed *(no component - pantry staple)*
- 3 tbsp white miso paste *(no component - pantry staple)*
- 2 tbsp sesame oil *(no component - pantry staple)*
- 2 tbsp dark soy sauce *(no component - pantry staple)*
- 80ml rice vinegar *(no component - pantry staple)*
- 2 tsp honey *(no component - pantry staple)*

## Instructions

1. Cook the noodles following pack instructions, adding the edamame for the last 2-3 mins of the cooking time. Drain in a colander, rinse with cold running water, and drain again.

2. Tip the noodles and edamame into a bowl with the sesame oil and toss to prevent sticking. Leave to cool.

3. Meanwhile, tip all the dressing ingredients into a lidded jar, seal and shake well to combine.

4. Toss the cooled noodles and edamame with the remaining ingredients and the dressing, and serve immediately.

## Storage & Meal Prep Notes

### Leftovers & Reheating
- **Storage**: Best eaten fresh as the noodles will absorb the dressing over time
- **If storing**: Keep dressing separate and toss just before serving
- **Keeps**: 1-2 days in fridge (texture will soften)

### Meal Prep Strategy
1. **Prep ahead**: Cook noodles and edamame, store separately from vegetables
2. **Day of**: Make dressing fresh (or store in jar for up to 3 days), combine everything just before eating

## Notes
- The dressing can be made ahead and stored in a jar in the fridge for up to 3 days
- For extra heat, leave the seeds in the chilli or add more
- Can substitute prawns with cooked chicken or tofu for variation
- Noodles should be well-drained and cooled to prevent the salad becoming soggy
