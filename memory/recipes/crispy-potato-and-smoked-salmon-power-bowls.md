# Crispy Potato and Smoked Salmon Power Bowls

## Overview
With smoked salmon and red onion, poached eggs, greens, and crispy potatoes, gilded in a lemony sauce, this recipe brings together some quintessential New York brunch foods in a single bowl. And while not commonly paired together as they are here, each one plays off the other in such a harmonious and delicious way. This is a bowl I would happily start my morning with, any day of the week, and particularly if I had company or was hosting weekend brunch.

- 4 tablespoons (60 ml) avocado oil, divided

- 6 [salmon fillets](../components/proteins/salmon-fillets.md) (660g total at ~110g each)
- 8 [eggs](../components/proteins/free-range-eggs.md), hard-boiled
- 1 [English cucumber](../components/vegetables/cucumber.md), halved and thinly sliced
- 2 medium [avocados](../components/fruits/avocado.md), peeled, pitted, and diced
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### Lemon Kefir Sauce
- 1 cup (240g) [natural kefir](../components/dairy/natural-kefir.md)
- ¼ cup (60 ml) water
- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

### Prepare the Sauce (Can be made ahead)
1. In a small bowl, combine kefir, water, extra-virgin olive oil, and minced garlic
2. Whisk until smooth and creamy
3. Season with salt and pepper to taste
4. Refrigerate until ready to serve (keeps 3-4 days)

### Roast Potatoes and Onions
1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C)
2. Toss baby potatoes and red onion with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) avocado oil, salt, and pepper
3. Spread in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet
4. Roast for 20-25 minutes until golden and crispy around edges, stirring halfway through

### Bake Salmon
1. Place salmon fillets on a separate baking sheet, skin-side down
2. Drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) avocado oil
3. Season with salt and pepper
4. Bake at 400°F (200°C) for 12-15 minutes until cooked through and flakes easily with a fork
5. *Note: Coordinate baking with potatoes or adjust oven temperature to 400°F and extend potato roasting to 30 minutes*

### Prepare Spinach
1. Heat a large skillet over medium heat
2. Add baby spinach with a pinch of salt
3. Cook, tossing occasionally, until wilted (2-3 minutes)
4. Drain any excess moisture

### Prepare Eggs

#### Option 1: Hard-Boiled (for meal prep or next-day serving)
1. Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil
2. Carefully lower eggs into boiling water
3. Cook for 11-12 minutes for fully set yolks
4. Transfer to ice-cold water bath for 2-3 minutes to stop cooking
5. Peel gently and halve or keep whole for assembly
6. *Best for storing in fridge 3-4 days; safe to eat the next day cold or reheated*

#### Option 2: Soft-Boiled (for fresh serving)
1. Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil
2. Carefully lower eggs into boiling water
3. Cook for 6-7 minutes for a runny yolk with set whites (6.5 min is sweet spot)
4. Transfer to ice-cold water bath for 1-2 minutes to stop cooking just enough
5. Serve immediately in an egg cup and cut off the top, or peel gently for assembly
6. *Best enjoyed fresh—runny yolks degrade quickly if stored*

### Assemble Bowls
1. Divide roasted potatoes, onions, and wilted spinach among serving bowls
2. Top with baked salmon fillet, eggs (halved or whole), cucumber slices, and avocado
3. Drizzle generously with Lemon Kefir Sauce
4. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste
5. *For soft-boiled eggs: serve immediately so the runny yolk is still warm and runny*

## Storage & Meal Prep Notes

### Leftovers & Reheating
- **Component storage**: Keep components separate in airtight containers for 3-4 days
  - Roasted potatoes and onions: 4 days, reheat in oven or microwave
  - Baked salmon: 3-4 days, can be reheated gently or eaten cold
  - Hard-boiled eggs: 5 days
  - Wilted spinach: 3 days (best eaten fresh but reheats well)
  - Fresh vegetables (cucumber, avocado): Best used fresh; add on day of serving
- **Sauce storage**: 3-4 days in refrigerator

2. **Day 2 (Lunch)**: Reheat potatoes and salmon gently; wilted spinach can be reheated or served cold; assemble with fresh cucumber and avocado

## Notes
- This recipe bridges breakfast and dinner—equally at home for weekend brunch or as a high-protein dinner
- Hard-boiled eggs (vs. poached) make this significantly more meal-prep friendly for day-ahead serving
- Baked salmon (vs. smoked) reduces sodium and increases omega-3 content
- Baby potatoes cook faster than fingerling and have a tender, creamy interior when roasted
- The Lemon Kefir Sauce is key to the dish—it ties all components together with brightness and creaminess, plus adds beneficial probiotics
- For 6-serving variation, use 3 salmon fillets and 6 eggs with proportional vegetables
- **Scaling down**: To make 4 servings (original recipe), halve all ingredient quantities and reduce cooking times by 5-10 minutes
- Pairs excellently with fresh citrus (grapefruit or orange segments) for additional brightness
- Could add sautéed mushrooms for umami depth
- Works well with microgreens or arugula instead of spinach for peppery contrast
