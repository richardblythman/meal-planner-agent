# Seabass Bowls with Caramelized Onions and Warm Tomatoes

## Overview
This bowl is topped with a mixture of quick-caramelized red onion, warm, jam-like tomatoes, and lots of fresh cilantro—a mixture known as "Foster Sauce." It was the result of a game-show-esque moment when someone else did the grocery shopping and I cooked with a basket of surprise ingredients. Over five years of making it, this sauce has become a go-to for topping all types of fish, chicken, and grain bowls. On its own, radicchio can come off as assertive and bitter, but the sweetness of the sauce and richness of the avocado keep it in check.

## Scaling Notes
**Scaling Applied**: 1.5x for dinner + lunch leftovers
**Original Servings**: 4 | **Adjusted Servings**: 6 (3 dinner + 3 lunch leftovers)
**Ingredient Adjustments**:
- Grain Substitution: Freekeh → Quinoa (freekeh unavailable at supermarket; quinoa offers similar cooking time and higher protein content)
- All ingredient quantities scaled accordingly

## Ingredients

### Base
- 247g [quinoa](../components/starches/quinoa.md) (1.5 × 165g; converted from cracked freekeh)
- 3.75 cups (885 ml) water
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

### Foster Sauce
- 56 ml avocado or extra-virgin olive oil, divided (1.5 × 37 ml)
- 1 large [red onion](../components/vegetables/red-onion.md), thinly sliced (450g, 1.5 × 300g)
- 450g grape tomatoes, halved (1.5 × 300g)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced (9g, 1.5 × 6g)
- ½ cup (7.5g) chopped fresh cilantro (1.5 × 5g)

### Fish & Toppings
- ¾ teaspoon ground coriander (1.5 × ½ tsp)
- 6 [sea bass fillets](../components/proteins/sea-bass-fillets.md) (510g total, 3 × 170g Tesco packs, 2 fillets per pack)
- 2 [avocados](../components/fruits/avocado.md), peeled, pitted, and diced (320g)
- Dukkah *(no component - pantry staple)*

## Instructions

### Cook the Quinoa
1. Combine the quinoa, water, and a generous pinch of salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until all the liquid has been absorbed and the quinoa is tender. Remove from the heat, cover with a lid, and steam for about 5 minutes.

### Make the Foster Sauce
2. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 8 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and garlic, and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes soften and pop, about 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the cilantro.

### Sear the Fish
3. Heat the remaining 1.5 tablespoons (23 ml) oil in a wide skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Pat the fish completely dry with paper towels and season on both sides with coriander, salt, and pepper. Add the fish to the skillet (work in batches if needed) and sear for 2 to 3 minutes per side.

### Assemble
4. To serve, divide the quinoa among bowls. Top with a fish fillet, caramelized onions and tomatoes, and avocado. Sprinkle with dukkah.

## Notes
- **Fish Selection**: Recipe uses Tesco sea bass fillets (3 × 170g packs = 6 fillets). Nutrition calculated from Tesco label (137 kcal per 85g fillet). Other white fish (flounder, tilapia, striped bass) can be substituted with similar searing time, but nutrition will vary slightly.
- Dukkah is a traditional Egyptian spice blend; find it in international aisle or use za'atar as substitute
- Fish fillets can be prepped and seared up to 2 hours ahead, refrigerated, and gently reheated
- The caramelized onions and tomato mixture (Foster Sauce) keeps for 3-4 days refrigerated and reheats well
