## Instructions

### Make the Cilantro-Lime Dressing
1. Whisk together the oil, lime juice, vinegar, cilantro, cumin, salt, and pepper in a small bowl until emulsified. Set aside.

### Cook the Rice
2. Combine the rinsed basmati rice, water, and a generous pinch of salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until tender, about 12-15 minutes. Remove from the heat and steam with the lid on for about 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.

### Prepare the Blackened Chicken
3. Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F).
4. Mix together the smoked paprika, cayenne, dried thyme, cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, and salt in a small bowl.
5. Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. Rub with avocado oil, then coat generously with the spice mixture on all sides.
6. Place chicken on a lined baking tray and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 74°C (165°F). Rest for 5 minutes, then slice or shred.

### Make the Pico de Gallo
7. Combine the diced tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, and salt in a bowl. Toss gently and set aside.

### Make the Guacamole
8. Mash the avocado in a bowl with a fork. Add lime juice, salt, and cumin. Mix until combined but still slightly chunky.

### Assemble
9. Divide the rice among 4 bowls. Top with sliced blackened chicken, black beans, pico de gallo, and guacamole. Add a dollop of sour cream and jalapeño slices if using. Drizzle with the cilantro-lime dressing and garnish with fresh cilantro.

## Storage & Meal Prep Notes

### Leftovers & Reheating
- **Component storage**: Store rice, chicken, beans, and toppings separately for best results
- **Chicken**: Keeps 3-4 days refrigerated
- **Rice**: Keeps 4-5 days refrigerated
- **Pico & Guac**: Best fresh, but keeps 1-2 days (guac will brown slightly)
- **Reheating**: Microwave chicken and rice together; serve toppings cold

### Meal Prep Strategy
1. **Day 1**: Make full recipe for dinner
2. **Day 2+**: Use leftovers for lunch - reheat protein and rice, add fresh toppings
3. **Batch cooking**: Double the chicken and rice for easy weeknight meals

## Notes
- **Cooking Tip**: The blackened spice crust creates amazing flavour. Don't skip patting the chicken dry—it helps the spices adhere.
- **Heat Level**: Adjust cayenne to taste. Start with ¼ teaspoon for milder heat.
- **Dressing**: Makes extra—keeps refrigerated for up to 1 week.
- **Variations**: Try with shrimp or tofu for variety.
- **Fresh is Best**: The pico de gallo and guacamole are best made fresh, right before serving.
