# Ginger Peanut Soba Noodle Bowls

I went through a phase about a year ago when I wanted nothing for lunch but instant ramen noodles. I had recently written about a hack for bringing more flavor to the noodles by simmering sliced ginger in the water, and another for stirring in a spoonful of peanut butter at the end. On their own, each was blissfully good. But together, they made my noodles irresistibly amazing and I could not stop eating them. This is a much more wholesome version loaded with juicy strips of chicken and a good mix of vegetables, no weird spice packets necessary. The starchiness of the noodles and creaminess of the peanut butter thicken the broth quite a bit, so it's not quite soupy, yet not as thick as a sauce. And there's just enough of it to gloss over each bite of vegetables, chicken, and soba noodles.

## Ingredients

- 6 cups (1410 ml) chicken stock
- 4 tablespoons (24g) chopped fresh ginger
- 500g whole wheat noodles (2 packets from Tesco)
- 1/2 cup (130g) smooth peanut butter
- 6 tablespoons (90ml) avocado or extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (705g from Tesco pack), pounded to 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) thick
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 200g shiitake mushrooms (2 x 100g packs from Tesco), sliced
- 4 cloves (12g) garlic, minced
- 500g baby bok choy (2 x 250g packs from Tesco), trimmed and halved lengthwise
- 1/2 teaspoon (1g) red pepper flakes
- 2 tablespoons (18g) sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Combine the stock and ginger in a medium saucepan and simmer over low heat for 15 minutes. Add the whole wheat noodles and cook according to the package instructions. Drain the noodles and reserve the stock. Stir the peanut butter into the remaining stock until well combined; set aside.

2. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Generously season the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. Add the chicken to the pan and cook, undisturbed, until the bottom is well browned, about 5 minutes. Flip the chicken. Sear the other side until well browned and cooked through, another 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and set aside.

3. Add another tablespoon (15 ml) of oil to the skillet, along with the mushrooms, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until soft. Stir in the garlic and cook for 2 minutes longer. Transfer the mushrooms to a plate.

4. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) oil to the skillet along with the bok choy, salt, and red pepper flakes, and stir to coat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until wilted.

5. Slice the chicken into strips. To serve, divide the whole wheat noodles among bowls and top with chicken, mushrooms, and bok choy. Pour the reserved peanut sauce over the top and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
