# Green Curry Chicken and Quinoa Bowls

## Story

While most curries simmer all the vegetables right in the pot of sauce, this bowl is filled with a mix of cooked and raw vegetables for a variety of tender, crisp, and crunchy textures. Each bowl is finished with just enough brothy curry so that you get some with every bite. For these bowls (and all Thai curries), Thai Kitchen curry paste is preferred for its full, well-balanced flavor and the fact that it's gluten free and shellfish free.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup (175 g) quinoa, rinsed
- 2 cups (470 ml) water
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons (28 g) coconut oil, divided
- 1 pound (455 g) boneless, skinless chicken breast, pounded to ½ inch thick
- 2 cloves garlic, minced (6 g)
- 1½ tablespoons (9 g) finely chopped fresh ginger
- 2 tablespoons (30 g) green Thai curry paste (Thai Kitchen brand preferred)
- 2 medium sweet potatoes (300 g), peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 can (14-ounce / 392 g) unsweetened coconut milk
- 1½ cups (355 ml) vegetable or chicken stock
- 1 lime, zested, then cut into wedges
- 2 teaspoons (10 ml) tamari
- 3 cups (210 g) shredded rainbow chard
- 1 red bell pepper (150 g), cored and thinly sliced
- 1 cup (70 g) shredded red cabbage
- Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish (to taste)
- Fresh Thai basil leaves, for garnish (to taste)

## Instructions

1. Combine the quinoa, water, and a generous pinch of salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, keeping it covered, and steam for about 5 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon (14 g) of the coconut oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Generously season the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. Add the chicken to the pan and cook, undisturbed, until the bottom is well browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip the chicken. Sear the other side until well browned, another 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and slice once cool enough to handle.

3. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon (14 g) coconut oil in the same pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the curry paste, and cook for 1 minute longer. Stir in the sweet potatoes, coconut milk, stock, and lime zest, and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer until the sweet potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the tamari.

4. To serve, divide the quinoa and chard among bowls. Top with chicken, red pepper, cabbage, and sweet potatoes. Spoon the curry sauce over the top, and garnish with fresh herbs and a squeeze of lime juice.

## Cooking Notes

- **Chard stems tip:** Save the chard stems—they are totally edible! Toss them into the pot at the end of cooking. A few minutes is enough to mellow their bite and add texture.
- **Curry paste selection:** Thai Kitchen brand is recommended for consistent flavor and quality assurance (gluten-free, no shellfish).
- **Leftovers:** This curry keeps well for 3–4 days in the refrigerator. The sauce keeps everything moist, making it excellent for lunch the next day. Reheat gently on the stovetop or microwave, adding a splash of water if needed.
- **Chicken prep:** Pounding the chicken to ½ inch thickness ensures even cooking and faster searing.
- **Vegetable variation:** Feel free to swap vegetables based on preference or season. Broccoli, bok choy, or snap peas work well as additions or substitutes.
