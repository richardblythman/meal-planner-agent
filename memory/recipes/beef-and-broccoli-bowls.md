# Beef and Broccoli Bowls

These bowls are not that beef and broccoli. They are so far from it, yet at the same time pull hard on the underlying ingredients, umami-rich, savory flavors, and comfort we associate with that saucy take-out dish. This version is wholesome, nourishing, and packed with lots of green vegetables and herbs. It starts with an underrated and underutilized favorite: broccoli stems. Here, they're processed into rice-like grains and quickly sautéed for a tender bite with a mild-mannered flavor.

## Supermarket Packaging Notes

**Scaling**: 1x for dinner + lunch leftovers the next day
**Servings**: 4 (2 dinner + 2 lunch leftovers)

**Supermarket Adjustments** (Tesco):
- Ground beef: 1 × 450g pack from Tesco (recipe calls for 455g)
- Riced broccoli: 1 × 380g pack from Tesco (recipe calls for 455g - slight reduction noted but minimal impact on nutrition)
- Bok choy: 2 × 250g packs from Tesco (total 500g for 1 large bok choy + extra)

*Note*: The slight reduction in broccoli (from 455g to 380g) has minimal nutritional impact (~16g reduction) but uses standard supermarket packaging. If you prefer the full amount, you can purchase a second small broccoli and use the remainder for another meal.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup (185 g) white rice, uncooked
- 2½ tablespoons (37 ml) avocado or extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 450 g ground beef (1 × 450g pack from Tesco)
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1½ tablespoons (23 ml) coconut aminos, divided
- ¼ cup (12 g) chopped Thai basil
- 380 g riced broccoli (1 × 380g pack from Tesco)
- 500 g bok choy (2 × 250g packs from Tesco)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 scallions, thinly sliced (approximately 40 g)
- Kimchi (to taste)
- Bean sprouts (to taste)
- 1 recipe Miso-Ginger Sauce
- Sesame seeds (to taste)

## Instructions

1. Heat ½ tablespoon (7 ml) of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef, season with salt and pepper, and cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the coconut aminos and cook for a minute longer. Remove from the heat and stir in the basil.

2. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Add the riced broccoli, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the broccoli is slightly softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Divide among bowls.

3. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) oil in the same skillet, add the bok choy, and toss to coat. Add the garlic and a pinch of salt, and sauté, tossing occasionally, until just wilted. Stir in the remaining ½ tablespoon (7 ml) coconut aminos and cook 1 minute longer.

4. To serve, add the bok choy to the bowls with the broccoli. Top with beef, scallions, kimchi, and bean sprouts, drizzle with Miso-Ginger Sauce, and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

## Miso-Ginger Sauce

**Overview**: An ultra-savory, umami-rich sauce made with white miso paste and cashews. Even a small spoonful brings a dish to life. The creamy texture comes from blended cashews, while fresh ginger adds aromatic depth.

**Makes**: About ¾ cup (180 ml)

### Ingredients

- ¼ cup (36 g) raw unsalted cashews, soaked in water overnight and drained
- ¼ cup (60 ml) rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons (30 g) white miso paste
- 2 tablespoons (30 ml) water
- 1 tablespoon (6 g) chopped fresh ginger
- 1½ teaspoons (7.5 ml) toasted sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon (6 g) honey
- 1 clove garlic, chopped
- Freshly ground black pepper

### Instructions

1. Place all the ingredients in the bowl of a food processor or blender.
2. Process continuously until the sauce is smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Thin with additional water, as desired.
4. Serve immediately or store in a covered container in the refrigerator until ready to use.

### Notes

- The sauce can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days
- White miso is fermented soybeans with an umami-rich, ultra-savory flavor
- Cashews must be soaked overnight to blend smoothly
- Thin with water to reach desired consistency for drizzling over bowls

## Notes

- **Ingredient Tip**: Riced broccoli is no more than chopped broccoli stems that have been blitzed in a food processor and broken into small "grains" that resemble rice. When making your own, take a few minutes to peel away the tough outer layer of the stem. It makes a big difference, leaving you with broccoli rice that's tender rather than tough and chewy.
