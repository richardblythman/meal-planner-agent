- **Fiber**: 15g daily average from whole grains, vegetables, and legumes (peanut butter)
- **Healthy Fats**: Balanced mix from avocado oil, olive oil, peanut butter, fish omega-3s, and avocados

### Balance Notes
- **Carbohydrate Range**: 186g daily average; spread across grains, vegetables, and legumes
- **Calorie Range**: 2,200 daily average across dinners alone (note: leftovers for lunch add another meal; adjust expectations if eating both dinner and lunch daily)
- **Macronutrient Distribution**: Roughly 25% protein, 34% carbs, 41% fat—a balanced distribution supporting sustained energy and satiety

### Dietary Considerations

## Preparation Notes

### Make-Ahead Strategy
1. **Beef and Broccoli Bowls**: All components store well. Broccoli rice can be prepped 1-2 days ahead; beef can be cooked ahead and reheated.
2. **Crispy Potato Salmon**: Roast potatoes 1-2 days ahead; salmon best made fresh or reheated gently. Sauce keeps 3-4 days. Eggs can be hard-boiled 2-3 days ahead.
3. **Freekeh Bowls**: Quinoa and sauce keep 1-2 days ahead. Fish best made fresh (sears quickly). Assemble with fresh avocado and radicchio on serving day.
4. **Soba Noodle Bowls**: Noodles, stock, and all components keep 2-3 days. Reheat gently to preserve vegetable texture.

### Storage Recommendations
- **Roasted vegetables & grains**: 3-4 days in airtight containers
- **Cooked fish & chicken**: 3-4 days; reheat gently or serve cold
- **Fresh vegetables & avocado**: Add fresh on serving day for best texture and flavor
- **Sauces**: 3-4 days refrigerated

### Leftovers Quality
All four recipes are explicitly tested and recommended for next-day leftovers. Components can be stored separately and reassembled at lunch for optimal freshness, especially fresh elements (avocado, cucumber, dill).
