# Freekeh Bowls with Caramelized Onions, Warm Tomatoes, and Seared Fish

This bowl is topped with a mixture of quick-caramelized red onion, warm, jam-like tomatoes, and lots of fresh cilantro—a mixture known as "Foster Sauce." It was the result of a game-show-esque moment when someone else did the grocery shopping and I cooked with a basket of surprise ingredients. Over five years of making it, this sauce has become a go-to for topping all types of fish, chicken, and grain bowls. On its own, radicchio can come off as assertive and bitter, but the sweetness of the sauce and richness of the avocado keep it in check.

## Scaling Notes

**Scaling**: 1.5x for dinner + lunch leftovers
**Original Servings**: 4 | **Adjusted Servings**: 6
**Grain Substitution**: Freekeh → Quinoa (freekeh unavailable at supermarket; quinoa offers similar cooking time and higher protein content)
**Note**: Ingredient quantities scaled accordingly. Lemon Tahini Sauce recipe should also be made 1.5x. Recipe stores well as leftovers; reheat gently or serve cold.

## Ingredients

- 247g quinoa (1.5 × 165g freekeh; converted from cracked freekeh)
- 3.75 cups (885 ml) water
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 56 ml avocado or extra-virgin olive oil, divided (1.5 × 37 ml)
- 1 large red onion, thinly sliced (450g, 1.5 × 300g)
- 450g grape tomatoes, halved (1.5 × 300g)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced (9g, 1.5 × 6g)
- ½ cup (7.5g) chopped fresh cilantro (1.5 × 5g)
- ¾ teaspoon ground coriander (1.5 × ½ tsp)
- 6 sea bass fillets (510g total, 3 × 170g Tesco packs, 2 fillets per pack)
- ¾ small head radicchio, finely shredded (225g, 1.5 × 150g)
- 3 avocados, peeled, pitted, and diced (480g, 1.5 × 320g)
- 1.5 recipes Lemon Tahini Sauce
- Dukkah

## Instructions

1. Combine the quinoa, water, and a generous pinch of salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until all the liquid has been absorbed and the quinoa is tender. Remove from the heat, cover with a lid, and steam for about 5 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 8 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and garlic, and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes soften and pop, about 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the cilantro.

3. Heat the remaining 1.5 tablespoons (23 ml) oil in a wide skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Pat the fish completely dry with paper towels and season on both sides with coriander, salt, and pepper. Add the fish to the skillet (work in batches if needed) and sear for 2 to 3 minutes per side.

4. To serve, divide the quinoa and radicchio among bowls. Top with a fish fillet, caramelized onions and tomatoes, and avocado. Drizzle with Lemon Tahini Sauce and sprinkle with dukkah.
